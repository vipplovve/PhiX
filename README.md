hi!

i made this project in my highschool as my Comp.Sci Project.

it took me about a month to learn about the Kivy module of Python, use it to develop a GUI based application and finally integrate it with MySQL DB to create a final product. 

i got to learn a lot of new things while making it was certainly very fun :)

How to use :-

you should have MySQL and python as well as Kivy module installed in your workstation.

there are about 3 different images which can be used as background for the app(currently i have set BG1 as the bg image).
peace:)
